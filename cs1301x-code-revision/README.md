# Introduction to Computing - Code Revision
Hey! This is my collection of code snippets (and some more practice questions solutions) from Joyner's 'Introduction to Computing' textbook that I use for quick revision during problem sets and exams. I also provide my solutions to the extra practice problems which have no sample answers provided in the course.

## You're at the right place if you're:
Current and past students of this course. I've organised the textbook's code examples by chapters and added my own comments to help with quick reviews. Think of it as a quick reference guide when you're coding along.

## What this repo has:
- Code snippets from the textbook (actual code, not just pictures)
- My personal notes and comments (take them with a grain of salt - they're mainly for my understanding)
- Everything organised by chapters, just like in the course
- Practice exam stuff coming soon (but no problem set / real exam solutions - that's part of the learning journey!)

## The Why
- It makes revision easier
- It helps to see how different topics connect by quickly switching between different parts of the course
- It keeps everything organised and easy to find
- Since the work's already there, why not share it and make others' lives easier too?

## Final Note...
- I'm probably not sharing the post-chapter problem set solutions, as they're graded and we can only improve by struggling through them ourselves
- I'll add practice exam solutions later
- Nothing beats going through every single question yourself
- While AI is useful, I strongly advise against using it to get solutions, please try to build every solution by yourself. If you struggle, that's a sign you're growing!
- It doesn't mean you can't use AI, but use it for unstuck yourself for clearning concepts along the way.

## Credit
All the code snippets come from David Joyner's 'Introduction to Computing' textbook (it's free online). I've added my own comments and organised it in a way that makes sense to me. If you spot any mistakes in my notes, would love you to open a PR.
For the extra practice exam questions, I provide my own solutions since these are ungraded and don't have official answers. While these might not be the optimal solutions, I hope they can inspire those who are stuck

As a learner, I really appreciate any corrections and advice that could help me improve this repo, whether it's the code, folder structure, or any other aspect.

*Good luck to your studies! ðŸ˜Š*
